      <h2 class="icon-hitode">About Us</h2>

<p>
At Japanese Schoolhouse, we offer a safe and secure place for your
children to play, learn, and grow with other children and adults.
</p>

<p>
We structure our program to be responsive to the needs of each child.
The main goal of our program is to have fun, improve social skills, and
prepare the children for kindergarten and academic success.
</p>

<p>
Childhood is such a short and magical time; we try our best to make
each day meaningful and special for each child.
</p>

      <h3 class="icon-kani">Kindergarten Preparation</h3>

<p>
Our goal is to create a fun environment where children have early experiences
that help them feel positive about learning. As they grow and become curious
about their world, the encouragement of their exploration becomes the
foundation for their future love of learning. In fact the information they
gather during their early years lays the foundation for academic success.
</p>

<p>
At Japanese Schoolhouse, children learn their ABCs, numbers, colors, shapes,
and both the Japanese and English languages through a variety of exercises
including art projects, playing games, singing songs, and lots more.
</p>

    <h3 class="icon-kani">Bilingual Education</h3>

<p>
We speak both English and Japanese fluently and your child will learn both
languages.
</p>

    <h3 class="icon-kani">Healthy Homemade Meals</h3>

<p>
We provide organic, homemade, nourishing meals at no additional cost to you.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Organic ingredients are used whenever possible.</li>
  <li>Breakfast (8:00), lunch (11:45), and snack (3:00).</li>
  <li>No pre-packaged meals. We make most everything from scratch.</li>
  <li>We emphasize nutritious foods such as whole grains, fresh fruits, and vegetables.</li>
  <li>Children 2 years and older will participate in our cooking projects which encourage your child to learn about healthy food choices and the joys of cooking and baking.</li>
  <li>Infants and toddlers will not necessarily follow the same schedule as the preschoolers.</li>
  <li>Infants are always fed on demand and toddlers usually eat meals with the older children.</li>
</ul>

<p>

</p>

    <h3 class="icon-kani">Cleanliness, Hygiene, and Safety</h3>

<p>
We do our best to maintain strict cleanliness and hygiene standards.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hands are frequently washed (before and after meals, after toileting, diapering, wiping noses, after messy projects, playing outdoors, etc.)</li>
  <li>Children sleep in separate cribs or on sleeping mats, using clean sheets and blankets used only by them, and washed weekly or as often as necessary.</li>
  <li>Our facility is completely child-proofed and also includes a fenced back yard so your child can play safely both indoors and outdoors.</li>
  <li>We take our shoes off inside which provides clean indoor play space for children.</li>
</ul>

<p>
All employees of Japanese Schoolhouse obtain the following certifications and
clearances. Your child will be cared by trusted and experienced caregivers.
</p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.yelp.com/biz/japanese-schoolhouse-preschool-albany">

<p>
When I moved back here 6 months ago with my then 19 month old daughter, I
needed a daycare until she went to Step One upon turning two. I found out about
Japanese Schoolhouse, went and visited the following week.
</p>

<p>
The minute I saw the place and had a chance to speak with Nao, I knew that I
wanted my daughter to go there. She cooks amazing, nutritious meals, and they
speak Japanese. Although neither myself or my husband speak Japanese, we
thought that it would be such an important opportunity for her to be exposed to
a second language. Immediately upon starting, she was happy to go to school
every day. All of the people that work there are warm, and she gets plenty of
individual attention as it is a small group.We get updated daily on their
delicious meals and what they have done during the day.
</p>

<p>
My daughter turned two in June, and we decided to pass on Step One and keep her
at Japanese Schoolhouse, and we couldn't be happier. Nao has been extremely
helpful with potty training, and my daughter has picked up on great manners and
is speaking Japanese! I would highly recommend Japanese Schoolhouse.
